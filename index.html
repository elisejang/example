  <h1> Elise Jang</h1>
	<p> I am a 3rd year computer science major at UCI who is heavily involved on campus with organizations like Women in Computer Science, Product Association at UCI, Korean American Student Association, and Hack at UCI. Being involved on campus is a way for me to be social and get to explore my professional interests as well. Additionally, I work two jobs on the side. One as a Computer Science tutor to students ranging from the age of 7-13, and another as a Digital Project Management Intern turned Digital Project Management Analyst at Ingram Micro. This past summer was an amazing experience in the project management side; however, I am looking to expand my interests in the software side of my career with an internship for Summer 2023. </p>
